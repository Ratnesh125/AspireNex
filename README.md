Build a website which would take a URL as input. That URL would be most likely of a product listed on any
ecommerce website. You have to make sure to fetch the entire data from the web page of that product and
display it into more readable and more summarised way on the website. You can start out with some specific
products like smartphones, but more type of products your website deals with, better your skill sets are. You
can even add comparison option to compare between two or more similar products on the basis of their
specifications. In this assignment you might have to use several different external API and libraries. The
